## 😎 What's the reason for this module in BCAD?

In your first two years, you learnt Java and C#, among other technologies. This module is in place to cover several aspects to elevate your programming prowess. Some things to note:

- ⚡ It is technically more complex (more can break here than ever before).
- 🏗 We will learn about design patterns which solve common programming problems and help us write better code.
- 🏛 We will learn about the implementation of architecture patterns that will allow us to build apps that cater to several users with robustness.
- ☁ We will learn how to use containerisation and DevOps to deliver our apps.
- 🎯 We will cover content that you will be asked about in job interviews around architecture and infrastructure (Trust me. I've been there 👨‍💻).

## 🏆 How will the module be taught?
- 🎓 We will focus on building you for a career as a software developer. This ensures you rock any assessment. (Again, trust me. I've done this before). After all, within a year, you will be done with this qualification 🎓
- 💡 Its not difficult to just pass, but I want to build rockstars! This means that you will need to write code, break things, and fix things. It's the only way in which one can learn code! 💻🔥
- 💻 We will only use VS Code for this module.

## 🛠 How does ICE work?
My ICE are simple, submit any four apps we built in class. At some point, I will give you GitHub Classroom links to claim repos which you will push to.  

❌ No submission, empty repo, wrong language, or blank submission = 0.

## 👋 Who am I?  
My name is Ebrahim, but many people call me EB (and that's fine). I am currently the Head of CS at IIE Varsity College Durban North. I don't really like writing about myself, but I am open to questions.

🚀 Let's build something great together!
