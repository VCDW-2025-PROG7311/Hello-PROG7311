## Activity: Architecting & Managing Development Freelancer

### Overview
Freelancer is a platform where freelancers advertise their services, and clients can browse, book, and pay for consultations. The platform integrates services like PayFast (payments), Firebase (auth), and SendGrid (emails).

As the system evolves, your team has been asked to propose an architectural strategy, operational model, and stakeholder communication structure using:
- TOGAF (for enterprise architecture development)
- ITIL (for service delivery and support)
- Zachman Framework (for multi-stakeholder views of the system)

You are part of a consulting team hired to evaluate and upgrade Freelancer.dev by adding a subscription tier feature and enhancing service support and communication. Research each framework and complete the tasks below using your knowledge of the three frameworks.

### TOGAF – Developing the Architecture
Use the TOGAF ADM (Architecture Development Method) to design the new Freelancer Subscription Feature

Tasks:
1. Define the Architecture Vision:
   - What is the goal of the new subscription system?
   - Who are the stakeholders?

2. Outline each of the following:
   - Business Architecture: Key roles, business processes
   - Application Architecture: APIs, modules, system interactions
   - Data Architecture: What data will be stored and accessed?
   - Technology Architecture: Tech stack (e.g., .NET, SQL, Firebase)
   - Opportunities & solutions
   - A migration plan

### ITIL – Managing Operations & Support
Apply ITIL principles to improve Freelancer's support and service delivery process.

Tasks:
1. Describe how you'd manage:
   - Incidents (e.g., payment failures)
   - Problems (e.g., recurring downtime)
   - Changes (e.g., introducing a new AI matchmaker module)

2. Design a basic Service Desk Workflow:
   - How do users report issues?
   - How are they resolved and tracked?

3. Define 3 measurable Service Level KPIs (e.g., resolution time, uptime, customer satisfaction).

### Zachman – Understanding Stakeholder Views
Use the Zachman Framework to describe how different stakeholders view the Freelancer platform.

Tasks:
1. Choose three roles: Planner, Designer, Developer.
2. For each role, complete the following Zachman perspectives for the Subscription System:

| Role       | What (Data)     | How (Function)      | Where (Network)       | Who (People)        | When (Time)        | Why (Motivation)     |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Planner    |                  |                      |                        |                      |                    |                       |
| Designer   |                  |                      |                        |                      |                    |                       |
| Developer  |                  |                      |                        |                      |                    |                       |

### Reflection Questions
1. What was the unique value of each framework?
2. Which framework felt more natural to apply? Why?
3. Where do you see overlaps between the three approaches?
4. How would you tailor your strategy if the business was scaling to multiple countries?

### Submission Requirements
- Submit a PDF or Markdown report to Arc with your team’s:
  - TOGAF architecture breakdown
  - ITIL support strategy
  - Zachman table
  - Reflection answers
- Include diagrams where helpful
