## PayFast Integration Activity Guide (ASP.NET Core Web API + Render Deployment)

This activity designed to expose you to the process of integrating PayFast into an ASP.NET Core Web API application. 
You will learn how to initiate payments, receive ITN (Instant Transaction Notification) messages, and persist transaction data to a JSON file.
You will also learn how to deploy the application to Render using Docker.

In this activity, you will:
- Build an ASP.NET Core Web API
- Use PayFast to simulate payment processing
- Store transaction details in a local JSON file
- Handle payment confirmation through the ITN system
- Deploy your project to the Render cloud platform
