# 🚀 Implementing a Singleton Configuration Manager in C#

## 📌 Scenario:
You are developing a **Gadget Store Management System** that requires a **centralized configuration manager** to store global settings. The configuration settings should be accessible **throughout the application**, but only **one instance** of the configuration manager should exist at any time.

## ✅ Requirements:
1. **Create a class named `ConfigurationManager`** that follows the **Singleton Pattern**.
2. The class should store and retrieve the following configuration settings:
   - 🏪 **Store Name:** `"Gadget Galaxy"`
   - 💰 **Currency:** `"ZAR"`
   - 📊 **Tax Rate:** `15%` (default)
3. Ensure that **only one instance** of `ConfigurationManager` is created and shared.
4. Implement a method **`UpdateTaxRate(double newRate)`** that updates the tax rate and ensures the change is reflected across the application.
5. In the `Main` method:
   - 🔍 Retrieve the **singleton instance** of `ConfigurationManager`.
   - 📋 Display the **initial configuration settings**.
   - 🔄 Retrieve another instance and **update the tax rate to 18%**.
   - 📊 Display the settings again to confirm that both instances reflect the updated value.
   - ✅ Verify and print whether both instances are the **same**.
