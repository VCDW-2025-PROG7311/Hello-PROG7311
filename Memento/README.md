# 📝 Implementing the Memento Design Pattern for a Text Editor with History Display

## 📌 Scenario:  
You are developing a simple text editor in a .NET MVC application. To achieve this, you must implement the Memento Design Pattern, which will separate concerns between storing, restoring, and managing text states.

## ✅ Requirements:  
The text editor should allow users to:
1. Enter text
1. Save the current state
1. Undo changes to revert to the previously saved state. 
1. Display version history so so that users can see the list of previously saved versions of their text.
